cga-parser
==========


 * uses spark
 * not complete, handles don't get parsed
 * we distinguish between int/float, real cga doesn't (baaaeh)
 * TODO write this readme
 * Add some license
 * needs some clean up, and I have no clue about 'best practices' in python, so it's a mess

``` bash
python example.py example.cga
```
